# Financial-Analysis-Excel-spreadsheet

Financial and Operating synergies valuation:

In this project the intention is to sell an online banking app technology (formerly Neo-bank) to a brick and mortar bank with no competitive banking app.
The spreadsheet is a valuation of the target, which basically consists of 3 main parts: Cost to duplicate the target, Financial Synergies and Operating Synergies.
Most of the different spreadsheets (models) are linked via original values (highlighted in blue) taken from either the financial statement of the acquirer or from market research.


LOOT CIM - Unicredit:

The pitchdeck (or CIM as it stands for Confidential Information Memorantum) is the detailed presentation of target's summary, its financial profile, the market research, the synergies and the reasons why the acquirer could be interested to proceed.
